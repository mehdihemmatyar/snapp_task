# Snapp Interview Task

**Description**:
This repository contains a machine learning notebook that trains a classification model using Random Forest, XGBoost, and data preprocessing techniques, with a focus on AUC and ROC curve evaluation. The project also involves handling imbalanced datasets and NLP tasks.

---

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Label encoding of categorical variables.
   - Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE and random undersampling.
   - NLP preprocessing using `hazm` for Persian text normalization.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Models trained include Random Forest and XGBoost.
   - Parameter tuning via GridSearchCV.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Uses accuracy, AUC, and ROC curves to evaluate model performance.
